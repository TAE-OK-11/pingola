# Local Pingora core patch

This directory is the source of `pingora-core` 0.8.1 from crates.io with two
small, documented local changes.

- Upstream package: `pingora-core` 0.8.1
- License: Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE` in this directory)
- Local change: `prometheus = "0.13"` to `prometheus = "0.14"`
- Reason: Prometheus 0.13 selects `protobuf` 2.28.0, affected by
  RUSTSEC-2024-0437. Prometheus 0.14 requires patched protobuf 3.7.2 or newer.
- Local change: an opt-in `HttpPeer::cache_reuse_hash()` method.
- Reason: fully prepared immutable route peers otherwise hash their address,
  SNI and pool options repeatedly for every connection-pool operation. Mutable
  peers retain upstream behavior because the cache defaults to `None`.

Remove the dependency patch after a released Pingora version adopts patched
Prometheus. Re-evaluate the reuse-hash cache whenever `HttpPeer` changes.
